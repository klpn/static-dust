title: A website with mortality charts built using Julia

Since 2015, I have run a website with cause-specific mortality trends. The idea
is to have a static site, which gives fast and easy access to information about
international mortality trends, using open data available from @whomort, which,
for many countries, covers the time period from 1950 up until recent times. The
website is inspired by @mortrends, which contains comprehensible charts 
with mortality trends based on these data, but has been unmaintained since
2013, when its creator died. Other sites with international cause-specific
mortality trends I have seen tend to be slower, due to dynamic chart
generation, and to cover only shorter time periods.

My implementation of the site generator, which was written in Python and R, had
become rather messy, and the chart tools I used
([matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/)) are not
really suited to make interactive web charts. I decided to rewrite the
routines to generate the charts and the site files in Julia (albeit with the
help of some non-Julia tools, as described below). These routines are now
available as a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/klpn/Mortchartgen.jl), and I
use them to generate the site in both [English](http://mortchart-en.klpn.se/)
and [Swedish](http://mortchart-en.klpn.se/) versions.

The site is built as follows with the Julia package (see the README in the repo for
instructions). The whole process is controlled with a [JSON configuration
file](https://github.com/klpn/Mortchartgen.jl/blob/master/data/chartgen.json).
YAML, using some non-JSON features, might be less cumbersome, and will perhaps
be used once there is full YAML write support implemented in Julia. Julia functions
mentioned are in the main
[Mortchartgen.jl](https://github.com/klpn/Mortchartgen.jl/blob/master/src/Mortchartgen.jl)
file, if not otherwise stated.

1. The @whomort data files are downloaded and read into a MySQL database, using
   the functions in the
   [Download.jl](https://github.com/klpn/Mortchartgen.jl/blob/master/src/Download.jl)
   file.
2. These data files contain cause of death codes from many different versions
   of the ICD classifications for different time periods and countries, and the
   codes are also often at a much more detailed level than I use in the charts.
   Therefore, the data on deaths is grouped using regular expressions defined
   in the configuration file. To avoid repeating this time-consuming regular
   expression matching, the resulting DataFrames can be saved in CSV files.
   There are still some issues with unsupported datatypes in the
   [MySQL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDB/MySQL.jl) package, which mean that
   grouping cannot be done at the SQL level and that prepared SQL statements
   cannot be used.
3. The charts themselves are generated from the DataFrames created in step 2,
   using the Python [Bokeh library](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/), which
   is well-suited for interactive web visualizations. I call Bokeh directly
   using [PyCall](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl), instead of using the
   [Bokeh.jl](https://github.com/bokeh/Bokeh.jl) package, which is
   unmaintained. There is a `batchplot` function to generate all the charts for
   the site using the settings in the configuration file.
4. The `writeplotsite` function generates the charts as well as HTML tables
   with links to the charts, a documentation file in Markdown format, and
   navigation menus for a given language, and copies these to a given output
   location. To generate the site files, except for the charts themselves,
   templates processed with
   [Mustache.jl](https://github.com/klpn/Mortchartgen.jl/blob/master/src/Mortchartgen.jl)
   are used.
5. The final generation of the site is done using
   [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static site generator written in
   Haskell. In the output directory generated in step 4, there will be a
   Haskell source file, `site.hs`, which, provided that a Haskell complier and
   the Hakyll libraries are installed, can be compiled to an executable file.
   This file can then be run as `./site build` to generate the site, which can
   then be uploaded to a web server. The resulting site is static in the sense
   that it has no code running on the server-side (but rendering the charts
   requires JavaScript on the client side).
