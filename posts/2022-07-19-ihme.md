title: IHME modeling on alcohol

Last week, a new IHME-coordinated Global Burden of Disease study was
published, on health effects of alcohol, stratified by amount
consumed, geography, age and sex [@gbd2020alc]. The study models
disability adjusted life-years (DALY), based on earlier studies on
the effects of alcohol on different health outcomes, combined with
GBD modeling of the prevalence of those outcomes among women and men
in different parts of the world. From this, they have modeled a
"theoretical minimum risk exposure level" (TMREL), i.e.\ the level of
consumption where health risks are at their lowest, as well as a
"non-drinker equivalence" (NDE), i.e.\ the level where health risks
are the same as for people not consuming any alcohol. The latter
measure may be interesting when TMREL>0, which holds for some age
groups in different regions, because the modeling includes studies
where some non-zero levels of alcohol consumption are correlated
with lower morbidity or mortality from certain vascular causes,
such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. With
increasing age, these conditions increase relative to other negative
health outcomes, where alcohol just increases risk, which means that
both TMREL and NDE tend to be higher in older age groups.

There has been quite a lot of criticism against the study, not least
the presentation of the results in press release and media [@angus20220715].
When age groups below 40 have TMREL=0, this has been framed as alcohol
being much more dangerous for young people than for old people, and that
young people should not drink at all. But health effects are of course
not the only relevant consideration when people decide whether or not they
should drink alcohol, and the study does not offer any guidance when it
comes to *absolute* risk increase for different consumption levels in
different age groups. As Angus points out, also mortality in alcohol-related
causes increases a lot with age, albeit not as fast as e.g.\ ischemic
heart disease. Moreover, the protective effects of alcohol, seen in
different observational studies, have often been questioned. If these effects
are not real, or if people drink in excess of the levels where they could
excess, a certain level of alcohol consumption will confer much larger
net risk for bad health outcomes for older people, compared to younger.

A striking result in the study is that TMREL and NDE varies a lot between
different regions, also for the same age and sex. Males in Eastern Europe
aged ≥80 have highest TMREL of all age-sex-region combinations in the study,
with 1.9 standard drinks (where 1 standard drink is 10 g alcohol) per day.
For the corresponding group of females, TMREL is 1.7 drinks, but for
e.g.\ women and men aged ≥80 in Western Europe, it is only 0.6 and 0.7
drinks. Similarly to the TMREL increase with age, this is a consequence
of higher background risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke in Eastern
Europe, relative to outcome where alcohol is assumed to have only negative
effects. To do such modeling in a sane way, you must have reliable region-
and age-specific data on both background risks for different health outcomes
and how these are affected by alcohol.

As I have written about, e.g.\ in my [27 March post](2022-03-27-transition.html),
comparing causes of death between
different countries and time periods is hard, especially in advanced
age. @Fig:circall_e0_f_1419 and @fig:circall_e0_m_1419 show life
expectancy at birth in relation to the share of deaths caused by
circulatory diseases for females and males the period 2014–19, for
countries with such data available from @whomort and @hmd.^[The charts
can be generated by cloning the
[blog repository](https://github.com/klpn/static-dust.git), installing
MortIntl with the relevant data files, as described in the
documentation, and running `circall_e0_1419.jl` in the
subdirectory `postdata/2022-07-19-ihme`.]

![Circulatory deaths vs life expectancy females 2014–19.](../../images/circall_e0_f_1419_en.svg){#fig:circall_e0_f_1419 width=100%}

![Circulatory deaths vs life expectancy males 2014–19.](../../images/circall_e0_m_1419_en.svg){#fig:circall_e0_m_1419 width=100%}

There is a rather clear clustering of countries, where one cluster has
high proportion of circulatory deaths (often 50–60 percent among
females, and somewhat lower among males), and another has relatively
low proportion (often about 30 percent). The countries in the former
group are often Eastern European countries, and tend to have shorter
life expectancy than the countries in the latter group, but not always
(e.g.\ female life expectancy is higher in Estonia than in countries
such as the US and Scotland). There is no clear correlation between
life expectancy and proportion of circulatory deaths within the
clusters. For mortality in most low- and middle-income countries, as
well as health outcomes besides mortality (included in the YLD part in
DALY), available data are even more sparse or inconsistent.

For Eastern Europe, and especially Russia, periods with increased
alcohol consumption have often been followed by increased total and
circulatory mortality, e.g.\ after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
@Leon2010 could not find any correlation between high alcohol
consumption and mortality from myocardial infarction and Russia, but a
strong positive correlation with mortality from other types of
ischemic heart disease. Similarly, @Wood2018 have shown a negative
correlation between alcohol consumption and non-fatal myocardial
infarction, but a positive correlation with mortality from other
ischemic heart disease. At the same time, @Timonin2021 have shown that
the distribution of ischemic heart disease deaths is different in
Russia than in other countries, in that a lower proportion of these
deaths in Russia are ascribed to myocardial infarction (e.g.\ just
12 percent in Russia 2005–17, compared to 63 percent in Norway
2005–16). From what I can see, the GBD modeling has not taken such
factors into account, even though it is clear that they may be relevant
for TMREL in regions such as Eastern Europe.
