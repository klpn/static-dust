Around New Year, the Swedish newspaper DN had an article about the
spread of contagious diseases, like influenza and covid-19 [@letmark241231].
According to the article, the viruses are "spreading rapidly"
because we have lots of contacts around Christmas and New Year.
Sweden has indeed had to influenza seasons in a row with reporting
cases peaking in last week of the year. At the same time, one must
remember that this is due to gradual build-up of infections the
weeks leading up to Christmas, when people have lots of contacts
at schools and workplaces. If cases peak around New Year, this implies
that $\r$ is on its way down. As the article also states, the spread
often increases after start of spring semester, but if a lot of immunity
has been built up, we may avoid later peaks.

In my Swedish [25 November post](2024-11-25-vag.html), I wrote about
infectious disease trends in Sweden during fall, with covid-19 on a plateau,
*Mycoplasma pnemumoniae* infections at high levels, and flu still at low levels.
Updated reports around the holidays are sparse, but data up until week 52
are available for Stockholm [@kulluftv5224]. Not much has happened with
covid-19, and *M. pnemumoniae* infections are now on their way down.
Influenza A has increased during December, but is still at lower levels
than during the December months 2021–23, and the increase has stalled
during week 52. As noted, we have yet to see whether there will be large
increases after the holidays.

An important reason for the early influenza peeks during 2021–23 is
most certainly that population immunity has been lower than usual, because
influenza almost stopped circulating during the pandemic. Now, when
we have had both A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria circulating after
2021, we may see a return to a pattern with influenza peaking after
New Year. Such a pattern for influenza peaks has been most common in
Sweden for several decades, or more. In my Swedish
[22 June 2020 post](2020-06-22-normal.html), using data back to 1981,
I noted that peaks in total mortality already in December has coincided
with severe waves of seasonal influenza, as in 1988 and 1993.

On one of my old blogs, I wrote a Swedish post
[20 January 2011](https://diversepedanteri.blogspot.com/2011/01/treklover.html)
about cause-specific mortality in Sweden per month, for the years
1969–86, when ICD-8 was used and monthly statistics on underlying
causes of death in Sweden were included in published reports, later
made available via @scbdor1196. For the ICD-10 years, 1997 and onwards,
such statistics has recently been made available via @sosdormanaden.
For the ICD-8 period, the monthly statistics is available for all ages,
and ages above 75, but for the ICD-10 period, only statistics for all ages
is currently published.

In the monthly ICD-8 statistics, important categories for respiratory
infections include "acute respiratory infections and influenza" (ICD-8
460–478) and "pneumonia" (ICD-8 480–486), while the newer statistics
uses the block "influenza and pneumonia" (ICD-10 J09–J18), where the
use of the "and" conjunction often causes confusion, both in
Swedish^[I wrote about a Swedish example in my [14 March 2020
post](2020-03-14-enkel.html).] and English as it might be interpreted
as referring to having both influenza and pneumonia, not (at least)
one of the diseases. @Fig:f27 and @fig:f28 show number of deaths
among females and males in Sweden, all ages, per month 1969–86, for
the mentioned ICD-8 categories, and @fig:j0918 shows these data
for influenza and pneumonia 1997–2024, with preliminary data available
up until September 2024.^[The figures may be reproduced in R by cloning

running `2025-01-03-fire.r` in the subdirectory `postdata/2025-01-03-fire`.
Note that the figures for 1969–86 are based on data in the PDF reports
and may contain transcription errors.]

The graphs clearly show that mortality peaks already in December or
January have been relatively uncommon during both periods. In 1969,
the A(H3N2) pandemic peaked around New Year, and caused significant
peaks in both of the respiratory categories. After a calm 1970/71
season, there was a new peak in late 1971, which perhaps may be seen
as a second pandemic wave in Sweden. Otherwise, there are no clear
December peaks during the 1969–86 period. The severe A(H3N2) seasons
1988/89 and 1993/94 occurred both during the ICD-9 period, for which
no monthly cause-specific statistics has been published yet, even
though the excess total mortality is clear, as noted above. For the
ICD-10 period, December and January peaks in the respiratory
categories can be seen for 1999/2000, 2003/04, 2016/17, and the latest
years, from 2021/22. Note that the latest seasons are not large in
size, compared to e.g. 2018. Even though "immunity debt" after the
decreased circulation in 2020–21 seems to have influenced the timing of
the influenza seasons, they have not necessarily been much larger than
usual in terms of e.g. mortality. In this respect, antigenic drift,
relative to the strains people have been exposed to earlier in life,
may be more important than waning immunity for influenza [@munro:hal-04731541].

One must remember that these respiratory captures by no means capture
all excess mortality caused by influenza. The smaller ICD-8 category,
"acute respiratory infections and influenza" is probably rather specific
for influenza-related mortality, but has low sensitivity. The categories
including pneumonia are probably neither very sensitive or specific.
As I noted in my 2011 post, much influenza-related mortality is ascribed
to circulatory causes, and in recent years probably often dementia.
For example, @fig:f24_75 shows deaths among females and males in Sweden
1969–86 with "other ischemic heart disease" (ICD-8 411–414) as cause
of death.

![Deaths by sex and month 1969–86 other ischemic heart disease Sweden.](../../images/se_6986_f24_75_en.svg){#fig:f24_75 width=100%}

There are clear peaks in this type of mortality coinciding with, for
example, the flu peaks during March 1976 and March 1983. One may note
that the category is rather diffuse, and that many of these deaths in
recent years probably would have been ascribed to other causes, such
as dementia, in accordance with the trends I discussed in my
[9 December 2024 post](2024-12-09-quiz.html).

For several seasons during the late 1970s and early 1980s, there is
very little excess mortality from influenza. This coincides with the
reintroduction of A(H1N1) 1977, where older generations were protected
by immunity they had acquired when this subtype circulated
before 1957.  For similar reasons, they 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic did
not cause much excess mortality either. There are also seasons
dominated by influenza B, with low average age among cases, and
similarly low excess mortality.  One may take the 1983/84 as an
example. During the winter, Moscow reportedly had high influenza
activity, mostly influenza B, and most cases occurring among children
and young adults [@cdcmmwr3310flu]. Eventually, the epidemic reached
Sweden, and newspaper articles, searchable via @svdagstidn, indicate a
peak in Stockholm in early April, while mortality was at low
levels.^[Some may have caught it and recovered, only to succumb to
more sinister fates in early summer.] In contrast, the relatively high
mortality during the possibly last B/Yamagata season, 2017/18, when
cases were much older on average, as I wrote in my Swedish [8 February
2020 post](2020-02-08-snall.html), shows that this depends on
population immunity, and not on influenza B being more benign by
itself.
