title: Life expectancy and transition in cause of death patterns

This week, the Swedish statistical agency has published life tables
for Sweden 2021 [@scblten]. With the first waves of the COVID
pandemic, life expectancy at birth decreased from 84.73 years for
females and 81.34 years for males in 2019 to 84.29/80.60 years in
2020. For 2021, the numbers were again 84.82/81.21 years. This
reflects, of course, the decreased COVID mortality due to vaccination.
Moreover, the flu A(H3N2) wave, which peaked around Christmas with
rather high rates of illness among young people, did not cause
substantial excess mortality, which may, in part, be due to people
with respiratory symptoms having less contacts than usual with older
people and other risk groups.

The increase in life expectancy in Sweden, and many other countries,
up until the mid-20th century was largely driven by decreasing
childhood mortality, which also caused changes in the cause of death
patterns, with directly communicable diseases becoming less common
relative to age-related diseases, such as circulatory diseases and
cancer. In contrast, the continued increase in rich countries after
that, which was temporarily interrupted by the pandemic, is largely
due to decreased mortality at older ages.

@Vishnevsky2017 discusses the development in life expectancy and
causes of death after 1960 in Russia, compared to high-income
countries, in particular Western European countries. In the EU-15
countries, age-standardised mortality rates from circulatory, external
and respiratory causes have decreased greatly since 1970, while cancer
mortality has decreased modestly. The proportion of deaths from
circulatory causes has also decreased (from nearly 50 percent to about
30 percent), while the proportion of deaths from cancer has increased
(from about 20 percent to about 30 percent). No such changes have
occurred in Russia, where life expectancy has not improved much since
the 1960s (although it has improved relative to the dramatic increases
in mortality during the 1990s).

From this, one might conclude that the increased life expectancy in
rich countries largely has been about decreased circulatory mortality.
However, Vishnevsky points out that focusing on standardised rates for
all ages hides a significant increase in life expectancy for those
dying also of non-circulatory causes. In Sweden, for example, the life
expectancy for people dying of cancer or other neoplasms increased 8.2
years for females and 7.6 years for males during to period 1960â€“2010.
The corresponding increase for circulatory diseases (where life
expectancy was higher than for cancer already in 1960) is 8.0/6.8
years. It is clear that this reflects a marked decrease in cancer
mortality at young ages, a point similar to what has been made
earlier by researchers like @Riggs1994coh.

One factor not discussed by Vishnevsky is the impact of changing
practices in reporting causes of death over a long time. For example,
the increase in life expectancy has been particularly strong for the
residual category, "other diseases", in Sweden, with 20.0 years for
females and 17.8 years for males. This category includes dementia,
which was a rare underlying cause of death in 1960. Back then, most
people with dementia probably had circulatory or respiratory
causes reported instead, and the "other" category was dominated by other
causes, with a much lower life expectancy.

In light of this, it may be interesting to compare the correlation
between general life expectancy and proportion of deaths ascribed to
different causes in varying countries more in detail. I made a
Julia package, [MortIntl](https://github.com/klpn/MortIntl.jl),
which can be used to analyse such trends, based on cause-specific
mortality data from @whomort and life tables from @hmd. It uses
a configuration similar to my earlier
[Mortchartgen](https://github.com/klpn/Mortchartgen.jl), which I
have used to generate [Mortality Charts](https://mortchart-en.klpn.se), but
extracts data directly from the data files using AWK instead of
relying on a SQL database.

@Fig:circall_e0_f_baltnord and @fig:circall_e0_m_baltnord show female and
male life expectancy at birth in relation to proportion of deaths from
circulatory causes (as defined for
[Mortality Charts](https://mortchart-en.klpn.se/mortchartdoc.html))
for the Nordic and Baltic countries, with Iceland excluded due to small
population.^[The charts can be generated by cloning the
[blog repository](https://github.com/klpn/static-dust.git),
installing MortIntl with the relevant data files, as described in the
documentation, and running `circall_e0_baltnord.jl` in the
subdirectory `postdata/2022-03-27-transition`.]

![Circulatory deaths vs life expectancy males Nordic and Baltic countries.](../../images/circall_e0_m_baltnord.svg){#fig:circall_e0_m_baltnord width=100%}

The charts clearly show that improvements in life expectancy continued
for a long time among, for example, females in Finland and Sweden,
after circulatory causes became dominant, without any substantial
change in the proportion of deaths ascribed to these causes. That
proportion really started decreasing after the 1980s, when dementia
became more commonly reported
(see [Mortality Charts](https://mortchart-en.klpn.se/charts/neurdegall4290s1e1meanfalse.html)).

The Baltic countries, especially Estonia, have in recent years
attained a female life expectancy close to the Nordic countries, but
the proportion of circulatory deaths there is higher than it has been
in the Nordic countries at any point in time. In contrast, Denmark,
has had a lower proportion of circulatory deaths than the other Nordic
countries, a pattern which has been more pronounced in recent decades.
The difference in circulatory deaths between Denmark and Estonia in
recent years, when both have had similar life expectancy among females,
is greater than the temporal variation, over nearly 70 years,
in any of the Nordic countries.

From this, it seems that clear that great caution is warranted
in drawing any epidemiological conclusions from trends for
officially reported circulatory mortality over all ages.
