Last week, a newly published article about trends in US heart disease
mortality [@King2025] got some attention in social media. The article
describes changed mortality patterns during the period 1970–2022: at
the beginning of the period, heart disease mortality was dominated by
ischemic heart disease (IHD), above all acute myocardial infarction
(AMI).  During the half-century, there has been a large decrease in
overall heart disease mortality, but the decrease has been largest for
AMI, so that the mortality pattern now is dominated by other types of
heart disease, e.g.\ chronic IHD, hypertensive heart disease, and
functional heart conditions, e.g.\ heart failure and arrhythmia.
It is important to note that we are talking about underlying causes
of death, which can be added because exactly one is registered for
each death, and not cases where e.g.\ heart failure is reported as a
complication of AMI. 

I have written in my earlier Swedish blogs about similar patterns for
Sweden, e.g.\ on [2 December
2011](https://diversepedanteri.blogspot.com/2011/12/en-blir-tva.html).
With my [morr](https://github.com/klpn/morr) R package, cause of death
patterns over time can be plotted using the data available via
@whomort. Unfortunately, these data cannot distinguish between AMI
and other kinds of IHD for ICD versions before ICD-9, which the first
countries, e.g.\ US, started using in 1979, and Sweden in 1987. That
distinction is not possible even with recent data based on ICD-10 for
some countries using the abridged List 1, e.g.\ Russia. Made with the
functions from the morr package, @fig:cpall2450a1 and @fig:cpall4290a1
show sex-specific cause of death patterns for all ages for the US and
Sweden.^[The figures may be reproduced in R by cloning
[the blog repository](https://github.com/klpn/static-dust.git) and
running `2025-07-04-attack.r` in the subdirectory `postdata/2025-07-04-attack`.
The causes are listed in the `capat` vector in that file, using the
cause definitions with ICD codes from the morr configuration file.
For Sweden, the AMI data for the ICD period (1969–86) have been entered
manually from PDF reports available via @scbdor1196, and may thus contain
transcription errors. To use these with morr (only for all ages),
you have to copy the files `ami-all-4290.csv` and 
`ihdnoami-all-4290.csv` from `postdata/2025-07-04-attack/data` to
the `inst/extdata` directory for morr.]

The graphs show that the share of all deaths with heart disease as
underlying cause has decreased since the 1980s, both in Sweden and the
US, and that this largely has been driven by a large decrease in AMI.
Non-AMI heart disease has remained relatively constant, especially in
men, with some smaller variations, as with covid-19 entering the scene
as a competing cause in 2020. Within that group, there has also been
some drift from non-AMI IHD towards other heart disease (e.g.\ heart
failure) and hypertensive disease. It seems rather clear that much of
this is due to changed practices in certification, coding and
selecting underlying cause, e.g.\ the shift to ICD-9, which was
accompanied by an increase in other heart diseases, both in the US and
Sweden. The remarkably low share of deaths due to hypertensive disease
in Sweden in the early 1980s points to a strong tendency to attribute
cardiac deaths, where hypertension may have been involved, to IHD.

It is important to note that there will soon not be much room left for
further lowering the share of all deaths due to heart disease by
decreasing AMI mortality, because the share of heart disease deaths
due to AMI will be so small that further decrease will not make much
difference. And the decreasing share of AMI deaths may also have
consequences for the validity of using models based on older data for
population-level attribution of shares of IHD, or heart disease,
mortality to risk factors, which may largely influence mortality
through their effects on AMI, like cholesterol.

For the overall decrease in the share of deaths due to circulatory
disease, as defined in ICD-8 to ICD-10, on which I made a quiz, as I
wrote about in my [9 December 2024 post](2024-12-09-quiz.html), the
decrease in cerebrovascular disease has also been significant.
However, I have plotted that group next to vascular dementia and other
dementia-related categories (including e.g.\ Alzheimer disease and
unspecified dementia). If one looks at these as a group, the changes
have not been that dramatic. And that would probably have been the
default way at looking at them, had cerebrovascular disease not been
moved from the chapter for neurological disease to circulatory disease
in ICD-8. With ICD-11, the category will be moved back, and it may
again seem natural to look at age-related neurological disease as
a spectrum, from more acute strokes over vascular dementia to mixed,
Alzheimer or unspecified dementia, similar to how the remains of the
circulatory chapter group AMI with chronic IHD, as well as functional
and hypertensive heart disease. One may also note that the group of
arterial disease except for IHD and stroke has decreased in parallel
with the increase in dementia. This group includes conditions like
generalized atherosclerois (ICD-10 I70.9), which may be regarded
as "garbage codes", when used for underlying causes of death
[@Naghavi2010], and may in the past often have been used in patients
with dementia without other obvious causes of death.

As noted in my December post, there are still countries with more than
50 percent of deaths due to circulatory disease, and many of these are
former Eastern Bloc countries. However, we should not, in that
context, regard these as simply present-day versions of Northern
European and Anglosphere high-AMI countries during late 20th
Century. As I noted in my [19 July 2022 post](2022-07-19-ihme.html),
their life expectancy may be as high as some Western countries like
US in recent years, at least among women. And the pattern within the
circulatory categories may also be very different from the older
Western pattern. As an example, @fig:cpall4188a1, shows the cause
distribution for Lithuania, for the same categories as in
@fig:cpall2450a1 and @fig:cpall4290a1.

![Cause of death pattern Lithuania.](../../images/cpall4188a1.svg){#fig:cpall4188a1 width=100%}

As can be seen, Lithuania has a low proportion of deaths due to
dementia, and a high proportion due to circulatory disease, like the US
and Sweden 50 years ago. But there are also striking differences, with
the IHD category being larger among women than among men in Lithuania,
and AMI only consisting a small fraction of IHD, regardless of time
period.  This is in line with the findings by @Timonin2021, discussing
differences in ascribing IHD deaths to AMI between Norway and Russia
(using detailed Russian data not available via @whomort, as noted
above). It remains to be seen whether future development, e.g.\ the
adoption of ICD-11, will lead to greater convergence between Western
and Eastern countries regarding these patterns.
